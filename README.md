# MyJobAssistant

**MyJobAssistant** is a job tracking application designed to help users manage and organize their job applications efficiently. It allows users to save job details, track the status of their applications, and retrieve all saved job information for future reference.

This project is currently under active development, and I plan to enhance it further to make it more robust, user-friendly, and professional. Features will be added and improved over time, with a focus on streamlining the user experience and incorporating best practices in software development.

## Features

- **Save Job Applications**: Users can save job details, including job title, company name, job description, and application status.
- **Track Application Status**: The app allows users to track the progress of each job application, helping users stay organized.
- **Retrieve Saved Jobs**: Retrieve all saved job details with a simple API call, making it easier to manage your applications.

## Backend

- **Flask**: The backend is built using the Flask framework, handling HTTP requests and managing the application logic.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used for storing job-related data, ensuring scalability and ease of querying saved jobs.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled for API accessibility across different domains.
